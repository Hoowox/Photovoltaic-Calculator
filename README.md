The program is an advanced photovoltaic tool based on Python, using libraries such as tkinter and matplotlib to create an intuitive interface and generate graphs. The main goal of the program is to precisely determine the amount of electrical energy produced by photovoltaic panels, taking into account various parameters such as panel area, tilt angle, azimuth, panel power, efficiency, ambient temperature, light intensity, and number of sunshine hours.

The “Settings” section allows for additional precise adjustment of information, which in turn contributes to obtaining even more accurate results. The “Monthly Irradiation” function allows you to set specific values for each month, and if you do not use this option, the program automatically reaches for default values. On the other hand, the “Monthly Temperatures” option allows you to enter the temperature for each month. If the user does not use this function, it is necessary to provide one general temperature for the whole year.

Entering appropriate data for both options for individual months results in their inclusion in the calculation process and presentation on the graph. This provides more precise results, providing the user with a comprehensive analysis depending on changing monthly conditions. The settings entered in the “Settings” section allow you to customize the program to individual needs, guaranteeing optimal quality of results.

The “Save” section plays an important role in enabling the saving of all data entered into the program, including information about the area, tilt angle, azimuth, panel power, etc. In addition, this section allows you to save settings, such as information about monthly irradiations and monthly temperatures. Additionally, this function allows you to save the received graphs, which allows the user to archive and later refer to the results of visual analysis. Thanks to this section, the user can maintain consistency and easy access to key data and configurations, which is especially useful in the context of long-term analysis or the need to share results with other users.

The “Import” section allows the user to conveniently and efficiently import previously saved data, settings, and graphs into the program. Thanks to this function, the user has the possibility of easy restoration of previous configurations and analysis results, which significantly streamlines the process of working with the program.
